#Functional Programming
Summary of my venture into Functional Programming.

##Word list
Descriptions from random sources about related topics.

###Referential transparency
The capability to replace a word with a definition, without changing the meaning, nor have any resulting side effects.

###Function
Map a value to another in a known way.

###Arity
Arity, the number of arguments to a function. A “unary” function accepts one argument, a “polyadic” function takes more than one argument. Some functions accept a variable number of arguments, they are called variadic.

###Monoid
A monoid is a collection of things, plus a rule for combining the things where the rule obeys some rules. Functions under composition form a monoid.

###Associativity
It doesn't matter how applications are grouped.

###Existance of a unit


###Closure
Closure is combines two things: a function, and the environment in which that function was created. Closure is a function together with a referencing/lexical environment for the nonlocal names (free variables) of that function.

###Partial application
Partial application (or partial function application) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

###Currying
Currying is converting a single function of n arguments into n functions with a single argument each.
