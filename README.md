Descriptions from random sources about related topics.

###Function
Map a value to another in a known way.

###Arity
Arity, the number of arguments to a function. A “unary” function accepts one argument, a “polyadic” function takes more than one argument. Some functions accept a variable number of arguments, they are called variadic.

###Partial application
Partial application (or partial function application) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

###Currying
Currying is converting a single function of n arguments into n functions with a single argument each.
